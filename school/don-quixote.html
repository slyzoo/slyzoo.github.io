    <p>
      Alonso Quixano is a middle aged man, who lives in an unspecific area of La Mancha with his niece and housekeeper. 
      Mr. Quixano reads so many chivalric romances, he goes mad renaming himself to 'Don Quixote';
      renames his workhorse 'Rocinante' and is so delusional he renames a slaughterhouse worker, Aldonza Lorenzo, to Dulcinea del Toboso, his "lady love".
      He travels in search of adventure. he goes to an inn believing its a castle proceeds to call the prostitues "ladies", 
      he calls the inn keeper "lord" and tries to convince the "lord" to knight Don Quixote. 
      The inn keeper decides to play along and knights this delusional fellow. 
      Don Quixote soon begins holding vigil at the castles chapel, which is actually the inn's horse trough.
      The inn keeper, tired of Don Quixote "knights" him and sends him off away from the horse trough.
      Soon Don Quixote encounters a servent named Andres who is tied to a tree and being beaten by his master over low pay. 
      Don Quixote tries to get the master to stop beating Andres but the master just sends Don Quixote away and redoubles Andres' beatings.
      Don Quixote soon encounters traders from Toledo. He demands that they agree that his lady love Ms. Dulcinea del Toboso is the most beautiful woman in the world.
      One of the traders asks to see a picture of Don Quixote's lady love to see if shes really that pretty. Don Quixote gets so angry that he charges at the traders.
      The traders trip Don Quixote making him fall and one of the traders beats up Don Quixote. The traders leave Don Quixote on the side of a road.
      Don Quixote crawls home soon after.
      While Don Quixoteis sleeping, his niece, housekeeper, parish curate and the local barber burn Don Quixote's library blaming it on a non-exixstant wizard.

      Don Quixote asks his neighbour, a poor farm labourer Sancho Panza, to be his squire, promising governorship. Sancho agrees and they leave at dawn.
