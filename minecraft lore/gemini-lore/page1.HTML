        <h2>Gemini lore season 1 recap</h2>
        <p1>in the beginning several major towns developed. over time these were wittled down to 3. The Potato Kingdom, Serinia, and the Cozy Birch. Potato and Serinia were locked in a cold war, until a civil war broke out in Potato. The Previous King Chronos, fled to Serinia becoming a member of the nobility. Under the Orders of Kamflame a millitary operation took place taking over the remnents of the old land under the duke. Duke Chronos took control, soon after the independent people led by Slyzoo joined the newly formed Elderian Union which included Serinia, Potato, Squid cove, and soon later Cozy Birch. Egirl topia founded by Chip also joined the Union. Weird things began to happen including a Creature known as the Message of Void that killed several people. The messenger made it clear that his main target was Kamflame. Messenger calls Kamflame and Chronos to the fallen Capital of Serinia where he tells the truth of Kamflames past to chronos. Chronos not believing it only tries to kill the messenger to no effect. Kamflame goes into hiding and isnt seen again in the lore until the end of the season. Messenger continues his attacks and doubt spreading and even gets people inside the Union to turn against the King. The messenger eventually find and bests Kamflame in his weaker form making him use his true form. The messenger stabs Kamflame through the chest during the Transformation. This creates a Portal that ends up Destroying the world. However Kamflame uses what little power he had left to send everyone to a new world including himself however his transformation was only half finished. The resulting magic causes amnesia destroying all previous memories and alliances, For now.</p1>
